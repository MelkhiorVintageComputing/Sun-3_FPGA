# Read by syn/build.tcl: wb_to_mig_ui crosses from cpu_clk to MIG's ui_clk.
# From the Sun-2 project.  The cpu_clk handle comes
# from wukong_common.xdc, which is read first.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The Wishbone/MIG clock crossing
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# wb_to_mig_ui crosses with a two-phase toggle handshake.  The toggles go
# through two-flop synchronisers; the address, data and read-data buses are
# held stable for the whole transaction and so are a classic multi-cycle path.
# Bound both by one destination clock period rather than leaving them false, so
# a wildly slow route still gets flagged.
#
# Ask the design what the CPU period actually is rather than writing it down:
# this used to be a literal 80.000, which is 12.5 MHz, and stayed 80 ns when
# built at CPU_HZ=40000000 -- leaving these four bounds 3.2x too loose without
# failing, because they are upper bounds on datapaths rather than clock
# constraints.
# The CPU and MIG clocks, asynchronous, as they always were with this adapter
# (wukong_common.xdc leaves the pair to this file).  This outranks the bounds
# below, which therefore stay documentation: exceptions_ignored.rpt lists them.
