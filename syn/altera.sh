# Copied from the Sun-2 project, which took the shape from the RD68011
# project uses -- this is a copy rather than a reference, because Inputs/ is
# immutable and a build that reached into a submodule for its own tooling would
# break the moment that submodule moved.
#
# Quartus needs no settings script: its bin/ is self-contained, so this is a
# PATH prepend and nothing else.  It is the one place that knows where the
# installation is; point QUARTUS_ROOTDIR at another one to use it instead.
#
# QUARTUS_ROOTDIR is exported rather than merely used, and that is not
# redundant: Quartus itself reads it to find its device database, so a tool
# invoked by absolute path with a stale value set would silently fit against
# the wrong device data.
