//
// deca_wb_to_ddr3 against a model of BrianHG's command port.
//
// What this is really testing is a set of claims read out of someone else's
// source: that CMD_wmask is active high, that CMD_ena is a strobe gated by
// CMD_busy, that a write needs no acknowledgement and a read answers with
// CMD_read_ready, and that a 128-bit line holds four 32-bit lanes indexed by
// wb_adr[1:0].  Each of those is a place where being wrong corrupts memory
// quietly rather than failing loudly.
//
// The model deliberately makes CMD_busy and the read latency *vary*, because a
// handshake that only works when the far end is always ready is not a
// handshake.
//
// The two clocks are deliberately unrelated and far apart -- 12.5 MHz against
// 125 MHz -- since the crossing is the other half of what is under test.
//
// Under DECA_SYNC (make -C sim decaddr3sync) the same checks run against
// deca_wb_ddr3_sync, the FIFO bridge's adapter, with the Wishbone master on
// CMD_CLK itself and no crossing.  Both variants also count commands against
// Wishbone transactions: an adapter that issued one twice would pass every
// read-back and still double every write.
