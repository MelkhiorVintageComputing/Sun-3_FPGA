// Bring the TI DP83620 down to something a Sun-2 recognises, and then watch it.
//
// A real Sun-2 has no PHY: the 82586 drives an 8502 Manchester encoder straight
// onto an AUI cable at 10 Mb/s, and nothing in the machine knows what a
// management interface is.  All of this is an artifact of putting a modern part
// where that transceiver was, so it belongs in the board layer and not in the
// machine.
//
// The DECA twin of boards/Wukong/phy_rtl8211_init.sv, and a good deal simpler,
// because a 10/100 part cannot do the thing that made the RTL8211 hard.  Every
// register value below is from the DP83620 datasheet (SNLS339C), not carried
// over: the two parts agree on the clause-22 registers and on nothing else.
//
// What has to happen:
//
//   * The link must come up at 10 Mb/s.  Advertising only 10BASE-T does it.
//     Advertising rather than forcing, for the reason the Wukong file gives: a
//     forced link sends no advertisement, the partner parallel-detects and
//     falls back to half duplex, and the resulting duplex mismatch looks
//     exactly like a broken MAC.
//
//   * The part must be in MII mode, not RMII.  RBR bit 5 RMII_MODE is latched
//     from the MII_MODE strap on pin 39, which is the RX_DV pin, and the
//     DP83620 pulls it down internally (datasheet 3.9: "Default operation is
//     MII Mode with a value of 0 due to the internal pulldown").
//
//     The DECA schematic settles what the board does:
//     Inputs/doc/DECA_board/Documents/Schematic_DECA.pdf runs NET_RX_DV from
//     PHY pin 39 straight to FPGA PIN_P4 with **no external pull resistor** --
//     the 2.2K parts around there (R74, R231, R237) sit on pins 23, 21 and 22,
//     RESERVED1, CLK_OUT_EN and PCF_EN.  So the internal pulldown decides, and
//     the board is MII.
//
//     This still clears the bit, and the reason is better than "in case":
//     **the strap pin is shared with the FPGA**, and before the FPGA is
//     configured its pins are tri-stated with a weak pull-UP by default.  In
//     that window NET_RESET_n also floats high, so the PHY is not held in
//     reset and latches MII_MODE = 1 -- RMII.  What saves it is that
//     deca_top drives NET_RESET_n low from board_reset_raw once configured, so
//     the part re-latches its straps with the FPGA now holding RX_DV as a
//     plain input.  That recovery is load-bearing and was implicit; clearing
//     RBR explicitly means the machine does not depend on it being right.
//
//   * There is no gigabit register to withdraw and no "assert CRS on transmit"
//     to clear.  Both of those were GMII-specific problems on the Realtek part.
//     Nothing here stands in for them, and adding a speculative write would be
//     worse than nothing.
//
// Ordering still matters: ANAR takes effect on an autonegotiation restart, so
// BMCR comes last.  There is no software reset -- the board has done a hardware
// one, which is stronger, and a reset would return the straps.
//

    // Address 1, and that is the strapped default rather than a choice.
    // PHYAD0 is on the COL pin with a weak internal pull-UP; PHYAD[4:1] are on
    // RXD[3:0] with pull-DOWNs (datasheet 3.9), so an unstrapped board latches
    // 00001.  The DECA schematic shows no external pull on NET_COL or NET_RXD,
    // so the internal defaults stand.
    //
    // TI's pull-up on the least significant bit is deliberate and worth
    // knowing: **address 0 puts the part into MII Isolate Mode**, where it
    // ignores the MII bus altogether.  A board that strapped its way to 0 would
    // have a PHY that answers management perfectly and passes no traffic.
