//
// 8N1 receiver, 16x oversampling.
//
// One half of the bridge between the Sun-2's SCC and the DECA's JTAG UART.  The
// machine's console is a *serial line* -- z8530_scc.sv drives txda a bit at a
// time out of its own baud generator -- and this turns it back into bytes.
//
// Clocked on clk_serial, which is what makes the arithmetic exact rather than
// approximate: the SCC's pclk and this receiver share one clock, and
// 4915254/9600 = 512.005, so a bit is 512 clocks and a 16x sample is 32, by
// construction.  On cpu_clk it would be 12500000/9600 = 1302.083, a rounded
// divisor that moves whenever CPU_HZ or CPU_DIV moves -- a console whose
// framing depends on the CPU clock is a console that breaks the first time
// somebody changes frequency.
//
// The input is still synchronised even though both ends are on clk_serial.
// That is not superstition: `tx' leaves the SCC through the machine's own
// output register and comes back here across a chunk of the die, and a
// receiver that samples a line it does not own should say so.
