//
// The Sun-2's console, over the DECA's on-board USB-Blaster II.
//
// The DECA brings no UART to the FPGA at all -- no RS-232 transceiver, no
// USB-serial bridge -- so the machine's serial console has to leave the chip
// some other way.  This bridges it to an altera_avalon_jtag_uart, which the
// host reads with `juart-terminal'.
//
// ------------------------------------------------- why bit-serial, not bytes
//
// The obvious shortcut is to reach inside the SCC and take its byte stream
// directly.  That is rejected deliberately.  The one thing this board has to
// prove is that a MAX 10 PLL's 4.915254 MHz drives the SCC's own baud
// generator (WR4 x16, time constant 14) to a usable 9600 baud -- and tapping
// bytes would bypass exactly that.  Keeping the bit-serial contract means a
// wrong PLL ratio shows up as a garbled console instead of hiding behind a
// working one.  It also leaves rtl/ and the `top' seam completely untouched,
// so the Wukong build is provably unaffected by anything here.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------- the clock
//
// Neither clk_serial nor cpu_clk: the board's own 50 MHz oscillator.  What
// decides this is not the baud arithmetic but **TCK**.  The JTAG Atlantic
// inside altera_avalon_jtag_uart crosses into the TCK domain, which the timing
// report puts at 10 MHz, and a user clock close to that rate reorders bytes --
// at 4.915 MHz, below TCK, the host read each byte twice and out of order; at
// 12.5 and 16.667 MHz, 1.25x and 1.67x, machine-to-host was clean and
// host-to-machine still came back with adjacent bytes swapped in pairs.  At
// 50 MHz, 5x TCK, a 48-character string echoes byte for byte.
//
// See boards/DECA/deca_top.sv for the full argument and the measurements that
// eliminated everything else -- the counters, the loopback build, and the IP's
// own source.
//
// ---------------------------------------------- the Avalon-MM handshake
//
// Read out of altera_avalon_jtag_uart.sv rather than from the handbook, since
// this is the one part of the design that cannot be simulated -- the IP ties
// its Atlantic port off under translate_off, so there is nothing to simulate
// against.  From the source:
//
//   :201  av_waitrequest resets to 1
//   :209  av_waitrequest <= ~(chipselect & (~write_n | ~read_n) & waitrequest)
//
// so a transfer is exactly two cycles: assert in cycle A where waitrequest is
// still 1, and in cycle B it is 0 and the transfer has happened.  Read data is
// valid in B and nowhere else -- read_0 is registered on the A->B edge (:233),
// fifo_rd is combinational and true only during A (:240), and the read FIFO is
// lpm_showahead="OFF" so its q appears one clock after rdreq.  All three line
// up on the same edge.
//
// Register fields, from :242-243 with FIFO_WIDTH=8, RD_WIDTHU=WR_WIDTHU=6:
//
//   DATA    (av_address=0):  [7:0] byte, [15] RVALID
//   CONTROL (av_address=1):  [22:16] WSPACE, 0..64
//
// The FSM below conforms to the *specification* -- sample readdata on the edge
// where waitrequest is low -- rather than to that derivation, so the two agree
// and a mistake in my reading of the source cannot become a mistake in the
// logic.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------ flow control
//
// Toward the host the bridge queues 2048 bytes and drops only when that is
// full -- 2.1 seconds of 9600-baud output, two M9K of the device's 182.  `tx'
// is a wire with nowhere to push back to, so blocking is not an option and
// something has to give eventually; the question is only how much slack there
// is first.  One byte was not enough.  The machine emits 960 bytes a second
// into a 64-byte JTAG FIFO, so a host that pauses for 67 ms leaves the bridge
// with nowhere to put the next byte, and it then overwrote the one it held --
// a silent loss mid-line, which is what truncated long output and left the
// shell looking hung until something made it print again.
//
// Toward the machine the DATA read is issued only when the serialiser is idle,
// so the JTAG UART's own 64-byte read FIFO *is* the flow control and nothing
// is ever lost.
