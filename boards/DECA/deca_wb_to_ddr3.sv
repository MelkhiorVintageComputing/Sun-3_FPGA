// Wishbone B4 classic slave  ->  BrianHG DDR3 controller command port.
//
// The DECA twin of boards/Wukong/wb_to_mig_ui.sv, and deliberately the same
// shape: the clock crossing and the 32-bit lane extraction are identical, and
// only the back end differs.  That file's client port was written abstract on
// purpose, and this is the first time that has been worth anything.
//
// The Sun-2's memory master (rtl/sun2-common/sun2_wishbone_bridge.v) lives in
// the CPU clock domain and issues one 32-bit access at a time, stalling the
// 68010 on DTACK until it is answered, so this is single-transaction-in-flight
// by design: there is nothing to gain from pipelining and much to lose in
// reviewability.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------- the address mapping
//
// CMD_addr is a **byte** address, and one command moves a whole cache line of
// PORT_CACHE_BITS = 8 * DDR3_WIDTH_DM * 8 = 128 bits = 16 bytes.  So:
//
//     byte address = wb_adr * 4
//     CMD_addr     = that, aligned down to 16   = {wb_adr[26:2], 4'b0000}
//     lane         = wb_adr[1:0]   which 32-bit quarter of the 128 bits
//
// The 128-bit line is the same width as MIG's user-interface beat, which is why
// the lane arithmetic transfers unchanged.  That is a coincidence of two
// 16-bit-wide DDR3 parts on a burst of 8, not a designed correspondence, and it
// would not survive a different DQ width.
//
// -------------------------------------------------- what is NOT like the MIG
//
// **The write mask polarity is inverted.**  MIG's app_wdf_mask is active high
// meaning "do not write this byte"; BrianHG's CMD_wmask is documented in
// BrianHG_DDR3_CONTROLLER_v16_top.sv:394 as "When low, the associated byte will
// not be written", i.e. active high meaning *do* write.  Reusing the Wukong's
// mask_for() unchanged would have written every byte the CPU did not ask for
// and none of the ones it did -- silently, and only on sub-word writes, which
// the boot PROM does constantly.  Read the polarity, never assume it.
//
// **The handshake is a strobe, not a level.**  MIG's client port here held
// c_req until c_done.  CMD_ena is a single-clock "send a command", accepted
// only while CMD_busy is low.  Completion differs by direction: a read finishes
// on CMD_read_ready, a write has no acknowledgement at all and is finished the
// moment it is accepted.
//
// --------------------------------------------------------- clock domains
//
// The controller's CMD_CLK is half the DDR3 rate -- 125 MHz for the 250 MHz
// build -- against the machine's 12.5 MHz.  The crossing is the same two-phase
// toggle handshake the Wukong uses, with three-stage synchronisers: address,
// data, select and direction are captured in the Wishbone domain and held
// stable for the whole transaction, and read data is captured in the DDR3
// domain before its toggle flips.  Only the two toggle bits actually cross.
