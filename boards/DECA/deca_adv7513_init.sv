// Bring the DECA's ADV7513 up and keep it up.
//
// The Wukong makes HDMI itself -- an MMCM, a 5x bit clock, eight OSERDESE2 and
// four OBUFDS turning pixels into TMDS.  The DECA does not: it has a real
// transmitter chip that takes parallel 24-bit RGB with HSYNC, VSYNC and DE on
// pins, and does the encoding in silicon.  The price is that it must be told
// what to do over I2C before it will emit anything at all, and that
// configuration is what this file is.
//
// The third twin of boards/Wukong/phy_rtl8211_init.sv and
// boards/DECA/phy_dp83620_init.sv: a board-layer sequencer that puts a modern
// part into the state a 1982 machine assumes, written here rather than
// imported so that it can be unit-tested (make -C sim adv7513) against an
// independent model of the thing it talks to.
//
// **The register values are not invented.**  They are transcribed from
// Inputs/doc/DECA_board/Tutorials/Porting-Cores/rtl_deca/hdmi/I2C_HDMI_Config.v,
// which is Terasic's own configuration for this exact board, cross-checked
// against the mandatory list in ADV7513_Programming_Guide_RB.pdf section 3.
// What is *not* taken from anywhere is the I2C engine: Terasic's is a
// bit-banged busy-loop on a divided clock that has to be named in the SDC to
// stop it floating, and it never reads the bus back.
//
// Two deliberate departures from the reference, both recorded rather than
// silent:
//
//   * **DVI mode, not HDMI** -- 0xAF bit 1 clear.  The reference sets HDMI
//     mode, which commits the transmitter to sending infoframes and audio
//     packets we do not generate.  boards/Wukong instantiates its encoder with
//     DVI_OUTPUT(1'b1) for the same reason, so this matches what the project
//     already puts on a monitor.  If a sink ever refuses it, 0x14 -> 0x16 is
//     the whole change.
//
//   * **No audio.**  The reference's twelve audio registers (N value, channel
//     status, I2S format, speaker allocation) are dropped, leaving 27 writes.
//     The chip has an I2S port and the board wires it; nothing here has a
//     sample to send it.
//
// What is deliberately *not* done yet: reading 0x42[6] to find out whether hot
// plug detect actually went high before powering up.  That is the sequence the
// programming guide blesses, and it needs a read path -- an extra direction
// through the bit engine and its own tests -- to avoid replaying the table on
// an interrupt that was not a plug event.  Replaying unconditionally is what
// both working references do and is harmless; the refinement is worth having
// only once there is a reason to think spurious interrupts are happening.
